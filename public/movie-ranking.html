<h1>The Best Movies According to SHAA</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>
   Directed by Christopher Nolan. This movie explores the life and work of Rober J. Oppenheimer. 
   During World War II, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. appoints physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to work on the 
   top-secret Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the 
   atomic bomb. Their work comes to fruition on July 16, 1945, as they witness the world's first nuclear explosion, 
   forever changing the course of history. <br />
</p>
<p>
   What makes this one of my favorite movies of all time is that Nolan's work is vast, he has a concept of using space
   to it's maximum. And creates a sense of tension throughout the film, a sense of dread and urgency, that makes you forget
   that it's a 3 hour long film. <br />
</p>
<h3>Tenet</h3>
<p>
   Also directed by Christopher Nolan. A secret agent embarks on a dangerous, time-bending mission to prevent 
   the start of World War III. <br />
   </p>
   <p>
   Why this fastly became one of my favorite movies was how Nolan took such mind-bending concepts of Forward and 
   Reverse time, to tell a story that flows in all directions. <br />
   </p>
   <p>
   One of the best scenes was shown twice, in forward and reverse, and features a fight between the protagonist 
   and a future version of himself. <br />
   </p>
<h3>Predestination</h3>
<p>
   While I was tempted to throw 'Inception' into the mix, also by Chris Nolan, I instad chose 'Predestination'. The 
   concept of this movie kind of shocked me after I watched it the first time. The synopsis is A temporal agent 
   (Ethan Hawke) embarks on a final time-traveling assignment to prevent an elusive criminal from launching an attack 
   that kills thousands of people. <br />
</p>
<p>
   What I found shocking about this film, mostly because it came out in 2014, was the concept of immaculate conception 
   and sex change. The character Ethan Hawke plays is the child of a woman who later becomes a man, and impregnates 
   himself as a woman. They have the child, who is Ethan Hawke, but then he is also his mother and father. 
   It's a bit of a mind-f***, but brilliantly done.
